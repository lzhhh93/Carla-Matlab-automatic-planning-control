# Carla-Matlab-automatic-planning-control

This project builds a demo test platform to evaluate trajectory following control algorithms for autonomous driving car in Carla simulator. 
Powered by Matlab engine, the control algorithms can either run in Matlab.

## Installation
See Readme.pdf for setting up the Carla  simulator, and this project from the ground up in Windows 10. Afterward, run python/automatic_control_revised.py to see a demo of linear trajectory planning + PID trajectory following control.


## Tutorial
See Tutorial for Automatic Control in Carla.pdf to get to know the structure of this project.
